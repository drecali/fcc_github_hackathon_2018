<div><h1>Hello FCC and GitHub World!</h1>
    <div><p>My name is Andrei Calinescu. I started Free Code Camp in January 2017. I'm really looking forward to the hackathon!</p></div>
    <div><p>For some reason, the preview in my browser didn't update when I changed the contents of my index.js file, so I had to use normal Gatsby instead of Ubuntu Gatsby as in the instructions. Hope this is OK!</p></div>
    <p>I just applied for my free ticket to the hackathon. Hope I get it! :D</p>
</div>
